# AcademicRecordBook
This is a learning project for me to learn and use Java and Spring Framework to build a web application.

# Project Goals
* Create an application that stores students grades.
* There will be three roles: Administrator, Instructor, and Student.
* A student can view their grades.
* An instructor can add and modify a student's grade that is in their class.
* An administrator can create accounts for both instructors and students.
* An administrator can also do what an instructor can do.
* All roles will need to log in to their accounts.
* Data will be saved to a database (will use SQLite).

# Build Environment
* Intellij IDEA Community Edition 2021.1
* OpenJDK 11
* Apache Maven 3.8.1

# Java Installation Steps
1. Download Java openjdk-11 archive and extract it to any directory. (E.g. c:\java\) (https://jdk.java.net/java-se-ri/11)
2. Append the file path of openjdk-11 to "Path" in "System Variables". (E.g. "c:\java\openjdk-11\bin" for Windows O.S.)
3. Add a new System Variable with the variable name "JAVA_HOME", and the variable value with the path of where openjdk-11 is stored. (E.g. "c:\java\openjdk-11" - exclude the bin.)
4. Open command prompt/terminal and run `java --version` to check if Java has been installed.
