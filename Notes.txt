Notes:
001 - As an Administrator, I want to log into my account that has administrator privilege, so that I can have access administrator actions.

A controller to get an account profile
    * when url looks like ~/{username}/account and account exists then it should get the account that matches the username and display it on the page - done
    * when url looks like ~/{username}/account but account does not exist then it should show account not found page by throwing an exception

An account object to hold a user profile
    * should have id, forename, surname, username, email, password, role

An account service that contains business logic
    * when getAnAccount(username) has been invoked, then the account with matching username should be returned as an account object
    * when getAnAccount(username) has been invoked, but the account does not exist then an exception is thrown

An account repository to access user profile from database
    * when a username is given, then record with the matching username should be returned as an account object
    * when a username is given, but the record does not exist then, then null should be returned
